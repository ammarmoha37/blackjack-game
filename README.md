My first game using JavaScript is Blackjack game.

While building this game I used my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

rules of the game:

- if you your cards sum is less than 21 you'r still in the game and you can ask for a new card.
- if you your cards sum is 21 you've won blackjack.
- if you your cards sum is greater than 21 you are out of the game.
